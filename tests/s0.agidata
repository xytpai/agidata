{"question": "a full stationary oil tank that is a right circular cylinder has a radius of 100 feet and a height of 25 feet . oil is pumped from the stationary tank to an oil truck that has a tank that is a right circular cylinder until the truck ' s tank is completely filled . if the truck ' s tank has a radius of 6 feet and a height of 10 feet , how far ( in feet ) did the oil level drop in the stationary tank ? a ) 0.036 , b ) 0.36 , c ) 0.6 , d ) 6 , e ) 3.6", "answer": "\"the volume of oil pumped to the tank = the volume of oil taken away from stationary cylinder . pi * 36 * 10 = pi * h * 100 * 100 ( h is distance that the oil level dropped ) h = 360 / 10,000 = 36 / 1000 = 0.036 ft the answer is a .\""}
{"question": "each week a restaurant serving mexican food uses the same volume of chili paste , which comes in either 35 - ounce cans or 25 - ounce cans of chili paste . if the restaurant must order 20 more of the smaller cans than the larger cans to fulfill its weekly needs , then how manysmallercans are required to fulfill its weekly needs ? a ) 60 , b ) 70 , c ) 80 , d ) 100 , e ) 120", "answer": "\"let x be the number of 35 ounce cans . therefore ( x + 20 ) is the number of 25 ounce cans . total volume is same , therefore 35 x = 25 ( x + 20 ) 10 x = 500 x = 50 therefore , number of 15 ounce cans = 50 + 20 = 70 ans - b\""}
{"question": "if n is an integer and 101 n ^ 2 is less than or equal to 10000 , what is the greatest possible value of n ? a ) 7 , b ) 8 , c ) 9 , d ) 10 , e ) 11", "answer": "\"101 * n ^ 2 < = 10000 n ^ 2 < = 10000 / 101 which will be less than 100 since 10000 / 100 = 100 which is the square of 9 next closest value of n where n ^ 2 < = 100 is 9 ans c\""}
